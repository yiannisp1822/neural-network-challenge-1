# Student Loans with Deep Learning

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook explores the application of deep learning techniques for analyzing and predicting student loan behaviors. The project leverages machine learning models to assess factors influencing student loan repayments, defaults, and other financial trends.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw student loan data.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key trends and distributions.  
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features for model training.  
- Deep Learning Model: Implements a neural network for predictions.  
- Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss functions.  

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter: jupyter notebook student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb  
2. Execute the cells step by step to preprocess the data, train the model, and analyze results  
3. Modify hyperparameters or dataset inputs as needed to fine-tune the model  

## Results
- The trained deep learning model aims to predict loan repayment probabilities.
- The final model performance is evaluated using test datasets.
- Visualizations illustrate key insights into loan repayment behaviors.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the dataset with additional economic indicators.  
- Experiment with different deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers).  
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time loan risk assessment.
